# Turtle-Geant4 validation

This example checks G4Turtle by computing the rock depth for a topography model (a PNG file from [share/topography/DEM_BACKGROUND_MASAYA.png]) via the G4UserSteppingAction Geant4 object.

## Plot

The python file plot.py plots the 2D image, depth = f(azimuth, elevation).

## Topography info

The file display.py can be used with mulder to display topography info.

### Install mulder with Python pip
```
pip3 install mulder
```
